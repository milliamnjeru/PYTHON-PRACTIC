##  Introduction to conditions and loops; 

-loops are constructs that allow a sequence of instructions to be executed repeatedly.

-They are fundamental for performing repetitive tasks efficiently and are commonly used to  process data in bulk.
There are several types of loops that is;

-For Loop_used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times .

-While Loop_is used to repeat a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. 
                     
                           # Questions
 1. Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess the number in a limited number of attempts. Provide feedback after each guess 
    (higher, lower, or correct).
    
 2.Write a program that allows the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and perform the corresponding calculation. Use conditional statements to handle 
    different operators
    
 3.Write a program that uses a while loop to check if a number entered by the user is a prime number (divisible only by 1 and itself).
 
4. Write a program that uses a for loop to print the multiplication table of a number entered by the user (up to a specified number of multiples).
   
   5.Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number entered by the user.
   
6.Write a program that uses a for loop to print a pattern of stars or characters like a triangle.

7.Write a program that uses a while loop to generate a random number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess the number within a limited number of attempts. Provide feedback 
  after each guess.


         ##  FUNCTIONS ;
               # Questions;

1.Create a function that will determine whether a number is positive or negative.

2.Write functions to calculate the area of different shapes like square (area_of_square(side_length)), rectangle (area_of_rectangle(length, width)), and circle 
 (area_of_circle(radius)).
 
3.Write a function called calculate_grade that takes a score as input and returns the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on a grading scale (e.g., A: 90-100, B: 
 80-89, etc.).
